    <p><em>Ricotta pancakes are deliciously fluffy, rich and indulgent-tasting.</em></p>
    <p><em>The blood orange adds a hint of refreshing, sweet and tart citrus, and of course a beautiful, bold color.</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p><strong>Pancakes:</strong></p> 
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup ricotta</li>
        <li>1/2 cup almond milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon blood orange zest plus 2 tablespoons blood orange juice</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Blood Orange Syrup (optional):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup maple syrup</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon blood orange zest</li>
        <li>Blood orange slices, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the pancakes: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, 
            baking powder and salt until combined. </li>
        <li>In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the ricotta, 
            almond milk, vanilla, blood orange zest and juice and egg until combined. </li>
        <li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir to 
            combine until the ingredients are just moistened (be careful not to overmix). </li>
        <li>In a large nonstick pan or griddle, heat the butter over medium heat. 
            For each pancake, add 1/4 cup of batter to the pan, 
            spreading the batter out with the back of the measuring cup into a round shape.</li>
        <li>Cook until the surface of the pancakes starts to bubble, about 3 minutes. 
            Flip the pancakes over with a spatula and cook until the second side is lightly browned, 
            3 minutes more. Serve warm with blood orange syrup, if desired. </li>
        <li>For the blood orange syrup: Stir together the maple syrup and blood orange zest 
            and heat in the microwave until warm, about 15 seconds. 
            Drizzle over the pancakes and serve with additional blood orange slices.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Cookâ€™s Note</strong></p>
    <p>If thinner pancakes are desired, add more almond milk. 
       Replace whole-milk ricotta with low-fat to lower the calorie and fat content.</p>
